Some first post ramblings.

---

Well, this is the farthest that I've ever come when trying to start my own blog. I've tried multiple times before, but for some reason, today was the day that I bit the bullet. I bought hogballs.dev, and hosted the site on Github Pages.

Why do I want to blog? What do I expect to gain out of it? Honestly, I just like the idea of writing, and expressing my thoughts in a casual way with reckless abandon.

So, who am I? I plan to stay anonymous on this blog, just in case I'm too based and say something that gets me cancelled... But maybe I'll come out of hiding in the infinitely-small chance that it's a Hackernews top post ;)

What I will say about myself:
- I was born and raised in a small town, doing tons of extra curriculars like dance, martial arts, and soccer
- I had a very rocky highschool career (acedemically speaking of course. I was unfortunately a party-hound) and dropped out of college after just one year to get hired at my current job
- I have 6 years of professional programming experience, all at the same company, from intern to senior
- I recently got medicated for possible ADHD (technically ADD), and have never been less stressed and calmer

My hobbies / obsessions include:
- Magic the Gathering (primarily Commander)
- Anime (One Piece #1)
- Manga (Berserk...)
- Video games (e33 is my GOTY 2025)
- My loving partner
- Reading books (Brandon Sanderson FTW)
- Learning programming (Currently on Martin Odersky's Functional Programming course rn in Coursera)

Maybe this will be my last post, or maybe this is the start of a long log of shitty opinions. Find out next time, on Dragonball!
