First post on this thing. Not sure what I'll write about yet, but probably a mix of:

- Random distributed systems TILs
- Career stuff that worked (or didn't)
- Hot takes nobody asked for
- Code snippets I keep forgetting

No grand plan here - just dumping thoughts when they seem worth sharing.

```java
// obligatory hello world in the language that pays the bills
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

More posts coming when inspiration strikes (or when I run into another weird Kafka behavior).
