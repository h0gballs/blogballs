I’ve tried multiple times before, but for some reason, today was the day that I bit the bullet. I bought hogballs.dev, and hosted the site on Github Pages.</p>

<p>Why do I want to blog? What do I expect to gain out of it? Honestly, I just like the idea of writing, and expressing my thoughts in a casual way with reckless abandon.</p>

<p>So, who am I? I plan to stay anonymous on this blog, just in case I’m too based and say something that gets me cancelled… But maybe I’ll come out of hiding in the infinitely-small chance that it’s a Hackernews top post ;)</p>

<p>What I will say about myself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I was born and raised in a small town, doing tons of extra curriculars like dance, martial arts, and soccer</li>
  <li>I had a very rocky highschool career (acedemically speaking of course. I was unfortunately a party-hound) and dropped out of college after just one year to get hired at my current job</li>
  <li>I have 6 years of professional programming experience, all at the same company, from intern to senior</li>
  <li>I recently got medicated for possible ADHD (technically ADD), and have never been less stressed and calmer</li>
</ul>

<p>My hobbies / obsessions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Magic the Gathering (primarily Commander)</li>
  <li>Anime (One Piece #1)</li>
  <li>Manga (Berserk…)</li>
  <li>Video games (e33 is my GOTY 2025)</li>
  <li>My loving partner</li>
  <li>Reading books (Brandon Sanderson FTW)</li>
  <li>Learning programming (Currently on Martin Odersky’s Functional Programming course rn in Coursera)</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this will be my last post, or maybe this is the start of a long log of shitty opinions. Find out next time, on Dragonball!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, this is the farthest that I’ve ever come when trying to start my own blog.
